# Tabletop Simulator Table

This library is **not meant** for distribution, I use this place to share my code and to reference it when I do need it. If you found this place through a link given by me or by a friend, hi I guess. If you found this by googling, be aware that these scripts even though are optimized as much as I'm able to they are also very specific to my table (which is not released in the workshop, still thinking about that)

I hope that whoever found this place will find the code within useful in some ways, sorry for no comments around but this is all stuff made for private usage.
If you need help you can contact me @Zavian#8253 on discord, just be aware that I'm GMT+1 and if you are from another side of the planet it'll be hard for me to answer at all times. Peace üêå

# What's all this stuff? How do I go around this repository?

Well, as a basis the nomenclature of the files makes pretty obvious, so through some logic and stuff like that, you'll be able to figure out most things, however, for an ease of use here's some info. Be aware that most of these things are DnD related, so bare with me with teminology:

-   card creator: A module to create a very simple object with two images in two sides and to automatically parse multiple inputs from zavian.github.io/generator/generate.html
-   initiative rectangle: A simple object that stores informations such as positional information of monsters that you spawn through **NPC Commander** as well as initiative stuff.
-   bag-peeker: A simple script to make visible the name of the first object in a TTS bag.
-   bundle-map: A script to put a map and objects of said map in a bag
-   calendar: Abandoned project
-   debug button: It puts stuff in other stuff
-   initiative-box: Abandoned project
-   initiative-hud: UI for managing initiative for a dnd combat
-   npc commander v0: The creator of monsters and NPCs as pawns in the table, this is the central brain of everything in my table
-   npc commander: A rework of v0, when I have time I just work on it.
-   pin-positioner: A script to position things on a map
-   pin: A script to manage informations on a 3D object
-   player-manager: A UI based on DNDBEYOND HP tracker but for ingame stuff
-   reset-characters: A script to position player's pawns in a specific place
-   rolling-block: Abandoned project
-   token-boss: See **token**
-   token-tracker: Abandoned project
-   token: Also known referenced as pawn, this is a monster/NPC 3D object.

If a file has a .xml version it means that it's both UI and Lua based.
