# Tabletop Simulator Table

This library is **not meant** for distribution, I use this place to share my code and to reference it when I do need it. If you found this place through a link given by me or by a friend, hi I guess. If you found this by googling, be aware that these scripts even though are optimized as much as I'm able to they are also very specific to my table (which is not released in the workshop, still working on that)

I hope that whoever found this place will find the code within useful in some ways, sorry for no comments around but this is all stuff made for private usage.
If you need help you can contact me @Zavian#8253 on discord (you can also find me in the official tabletop simulator discord if you don't want to add random friends for simple questions, you can join it here https://discord.gg/tabletopsimulator. I am **NOT** a Berserk developer and even though I'd like to don't ping anybody but me if you really need to ping someone), just be aware that I'm GMT+1 and if you are from another side of the planet it'll be hard for me to answer at all times. Peace üêå

# What's all this stuff? How do I go around this repository?

Well, as a basis the nomenclature of the files makes pretty obvious, so through some logic and stuff like that, you'll be able to figure out most things. Even though this is on github the actual context of most of these things isn't really anywhere, for now.

If a file has a .xml version it means that it's both UI and Lua based.

If a file is in the **DEPRECATED** folder then there is probably a better version of it or it has simply become useless by the implementation of different code.

# Who am I?

I'm a developer that has taken under his responsibility to recreate a series of tools to ease DnD into Tabletop Simulator. Don't think of me of anything as I am far from expert on the tool, however the scrips present in this page can be used in all sorts of manners, just be aware that there is close to no documentation, you can still concact me if you need to understand anything from the project.

# What is the purpose of all these scripts?

The things that I'm trying to achieve via these scripts is to reach a decent level of both automation and management of a DnD table, mostly for combat related activities. Many tools are inspired by other external programs such as Roll20, Foundry, FantasyGrounds, etc.
The end goal is to have a table that is both **stable** (still working on it) and easy to understand with all the features you may be in need for managing a DnD game.

# Credits where credits are due

It goes without saying that a lot of the things that can be found here are things that are gathered from the community, both from the official tabletop simulator discord (in which plenty of people have helped me) and other github repositories that I have found throught the years. Additionally a lot of the work could've not been done if it wasn't for the various top developers that can be found in the workshop. Among these there is:
* [Mr. Stump](https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrStump/myworkshopfiles/?appid=286160)
* [St0m üê±](https://steamcommunity.com/id/st0m/myworkshopfiles/?appid=286160)
* [CHRY](https://steamcommunity.com/id/chries/myworkshopfiles/?appid=286160)
* [Kijan](https://steamcommunity.com/id/kijands/myworkshopfiles/?appid=286160)

And countless more. If it wasn't for these wonderful people I would've probably not started making anything as daunting as this projects. üíñ
