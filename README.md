# Tabletop Simulator Table

This library is **not meant** for distribution, I use this place to share my code and to reference it when I do need it. If you found this place through a link given by me or by a friend, hi I guess. If you found this by googling, be aware that these scripts even though are optimized as much as I'm able to they are also very specific to my table (which is not released in the workshop, still working on that)

I hope that whoever found this place will find the code within useful in some ways, sorry for no comments around but this is all stuff made for private usage.
If you need help you can contact me @Zavian#8253 on discord (you can also find me in the official tabletop simulator discord if you don't want to add random friends for simple questions, you can join it here https://discord.gg/tabletopsimulator. I am **NOT** a Berserk developer and even though I'd like to don't ping anybody but me if you really need to ping someone), just be aware that I'm GMT+1 and if you are from another side of the planet it'll be hard for me to answer at all times. Peace üêå

# What's all this stuff? How do I go around this repository?

Well, as a basis the nomenclature of the files makes pretty obvious, so through some logic and stuff like that, you'll be able to figure out most things, however, for an ease of use here's some info. Be aware that most of these things are DnD related, so bare with me with terminology:



- average-button: Button to calculate averages with a given selection of colors. Kind of not working 100% but it does its thing. Related to average-notecard
- average-notecard: Related to average button, a place where to output its results
- bag-peeker: Name is self explanatory
- bundle-map: Bag that bundles a set of models and things into it
- calendar: Deprecated project
- card creator: Tool to parse informations from zavian.github.io/generator/generate.html into cards (for player items and the likes)
- **Commander Gen 2**: New version of the NPC commander, don't use the old one for your own sake. Want to see it in action, check out the workshop page [Here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2116098254). This is a private project that is strictly connected to this github project, if you are to use this there is close to no support as it still at a very draft-y state.
- NPC Commander v0: Deprecated version of commander 2
- debug-button: Simple tool to repackage things after updating them
- exploding_dice: Something based on the dice mat to work with exploding dice
- HUD: Interface to most of the tools for dungeon master and player
- initiative rectangle: Deprecated
- initiative-mat: Tool to order and manage initiative of monsters and players
- interactable: Tool to make things interactable (or not) on the fly
- map-positioner: Tool to unpackage things from bundled maps. Related: bundle-map
- notecard 2: Tool to parse informations from the NPC Commander
- notecard: Deprecated. Related: notecard 2
- pin-positioner: Button to position things on a map and make it easier. Related: pin
- pin: Tool to have a name underneath a pin or w/e else
- player_manager: Tool to manage a player's stats such as hp, conditions and the lieks
- reset-characters: Button to reset miniature positions
- rolling-block: Deprecated
- token-boss: Boss token. Related: token
- token: Token with NPC stats, such as hp, ac, movement and the likes.
- token-tracker: Deprecated


If a file has a .xml version it means that it's both UI and Lua based.

# Who am I?

I'm a developer that has taken under his responsibility to recreate a series of tools to ease DnD into Tabletop Simulator. Don't think of me of anything as I am far from expert on the tool, however the scrips present in this page can be used in all sorts of manners, just be aware that there is close to no documentation, you can still concact me if you need to understand anything from the project.

# What is the purpose of all these scripts?

The things that I'm trying to achieve via these scripts is to reach a decent level of both automation and management of a DnD table, mostly for combat related activities. Many tools are inspired by other external programs such as Roll20, Foundry, FantasyGrounds, etc.
The end goal is to have a table that is both **stable** (still working on it) and easy to understand with all the features you may be in need for managing a DnD game.

# Credits where credits are due

It goes without saying that a lot of the things that can be found here are things that are gathered from the community, both from the official tabletop simulator discord (in which plenty of people have helped me) and other github repositories that I have found throught the years. Additionally a lot of the work could've not been done if it wasn't for the various top developers that can be found in the workshop. Among these there is:
* [Mr. Stump](https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrStump/myworkshopfiles/?appid=286160)
* [St0m üê±](https://steamcommunity.com/id/st0m/myworkshopfiles/?appid=286160)
* [CHRY](https://steamcommunity.com/id/chries/myworkshopfiles/?appid=286160)
* [Kijan](https://steamcommunity.com/id/kijands/myworkshopfiles/?appid=286160)

And countless more. If it wasn't for these wonderful people I would've probably not started making anything as daunting as this projects. üíñ
If you feel unrepresented plese do go ahead and contact me.
